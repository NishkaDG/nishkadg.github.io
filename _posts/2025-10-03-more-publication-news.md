My second short story this year, "Deep in a Lightless Forest", has been published in [Tasavvur Issue 013](https://tasavvurnama.com/deep-in-a-lightless-forest/). Dark fantasy this time, instead of science fiction, in which a hunter confronts the monsters close to home.

I have several other stories in the works, so stay tuned!
